# Overview of Data Structure.

📖 Learning computer science is everyones dream in 2020 but where to start and how to start...❓

I have being in the IT 🖥 for almost 4 years now and I wonder what we learn in academics 🎓 are not what we implement instead how we learn and follow those concepts is one of the key factor the we use in industries.

I will try to include all types of data-structures with examples.

# What is Data Structure?

Simplest form ↠ data in structured format.

It is a way of organizing data in the system so that it can be used effectively.
